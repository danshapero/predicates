/**
 * Different sources define the "machine epsilon" in one of two ways.
 * The C standard library header `float.h` defines DBL_EPSILON, such that
 *     1.0 + DBL_EPSILON > 1.0
 * in double-precision arithmetic, but such that
 *     1.0 + z = 1.0
 * for any `z < DBL_EPSILON`. Many other sources, included Shewchuk's original
 * code and the supporting paper, define the machine epsilon instead as the
 * largest floating-point number such that
 *     1.0 + epsilon = 1.0
 * The two are related by
 *     epsilon = DBL_EPSILON / 2.
